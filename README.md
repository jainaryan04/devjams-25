# AI-Powered Operating System

We intend on creating an operating system that's fully based on making the most of artificial intelligence. An **AI OS** is a new type of operating system that is completely powered by a network of AI agents. Instead of a user-interface driven by a single central unit, it uses an ecosystem of specialized agents, guided by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, to manage tasks, tools, and system resources autonomously.

## How It Works

This AI OS is a new kind of computer system that works through a network of specialized AI agents. Each agent has a specific job, such as:

- Managing files  
- Handling network security  
- Organizing your media  

The key enabler is the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. MCP acts like a universal standard, similar to how Chrome extensions work across any Chromium browser. With MCP:

- Agents can run across any operating system without OS-specific rewrites.  
- Agents orchestrate the workflow among themselves, instead of relying on the OS to coordinate.  
- Agents communicate and collaborate by following MCP rules.  

For example, when you state an intent like:

> “Find all my photos from last summer”

the agents coordinate through MCP to divide the work, call the right tools, and deliver the result.

## Goal

The goal isn’t more clicks or commands, but a **self-organizing, agent-driven system** where MCP ensures:

- Portability  
- Interoperability  
- Intelligent task execution across all platforms
